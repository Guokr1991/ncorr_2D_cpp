# ncorr_2D_cpp

This is the offical repo for the complete c++ port of:

```

Experimental Mechanics 55 (6), 1105-1122

and contains the must up-to-date version of this code.

Future plans for this code are to write a real command-line executable to help automation and to containerize the code with Docker. Stay tuned!
